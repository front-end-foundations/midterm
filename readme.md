# Midterm

Select two layouts from the provided images.

Write HTML for the content (.txt files for the poem contents are provided for convenience).

Create CSS to match the layout as best you can. 

Since these are poems and line breaks are important, you should use the css `white-space` property: `white-space: pre;` for the poetry as appropriate. This will maintain line breaks without having to add `br` break tags.

You can use `flexbox` to create columns. You can also use negative margins, floats or the `display: relative` / `display: absolute` techniques we have covered in class.

In some cases you may wish to consider the CSS [columns](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/columns) property as well.

I may be difficult at this point but you should consider what happens to your layout on a smaller screen (responsive design).
