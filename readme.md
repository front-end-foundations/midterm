# Front End Foundations Midterm

Midterm time! Files are located [here](https://github.com/front-end-foundations/midterm). 

Select two layouts from the samples, write HTML for the content (.txt files for the poems are provided for convenience).

Create CSS to match the layout as best you can. 

You may use the css `white-space` property: `white-space: pre;` for the poetry where appropriate.
